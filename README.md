# mimasv2-blinking-led
An example code to make a project targeting Mimas V2

## ```make all```
generates the project and bitstream from top.v and pins.ucf according to make.tcl.
Before executing ```make all```, please change LIC and INSTDIR variables in Makefile.

## ```make gui```
launches Xilinx ISE Design Suite  (GUI) to open the project generated by ```make all```.

## ```make clean```
removes the project and bitstream generated by ```make all```.

## Configure FPGA
Please get the Configuration Tool from the official website of Mimas V2 and configure the FPGA on Mimas V2 using the bitstream generated by ```make all```. You can also use top.bin.gz (Please decompress) in this repository as bitstream to configure the FPGA for testing.
